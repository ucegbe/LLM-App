## My Project

This project walks you through how yoou can deploy a ChatBot that uses the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Technique. This ChatBot is Powered by [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/)/[Amazon SageMaker JumStart](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/jumpstart/) LLM/Embedding Models and uses [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/) and/or [Amazon OpenSearch](https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/) as Vector Storage and Retrieval Engines.

## PreRequisite
You would need to set up the following before succesfully using this app:
1. [Create Kendra Index](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kendra/latest/dg/create-index.html)
2. [Create OpenSearch Domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/configuration-samples.html) 
3. [Deploy LLama2 Models on Amazon SageMaker](https://www.philschmid.de/sagemaker-llama-llm) (Optional)
4. Amazon Bedrock Access to a suite of Models.
5. Deploy HuggingFace Embedding Models with SageMaker JumpStart (Optional)
6. Modify the application_metadata_complete.json file with the correct values of your Kendra index, OpenSearch Domain and JumpStart LLM/Embedding models as well as other information.
   
## Set Up StreamLit Front-End
The streamlit app for this prioject is located in *rag_advanced.py*.

To run this Streamlit App on Sagemaker Studio follow the steps in the link below:
* [Set Up SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/onboard-quick-start.html)
* [Launch SageMaker Studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-launch.html)
* [Clone this git repo into studio](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-tasks-git.html)
* Open a system terminal by clicking on **Amazon SageMaker Studio** and then **System Terminal** as shown in the diagram below
* <img src="images/studio-new-launcher.png" width="600"/>
* Navigate into the cloned repository directory using the `cd` command and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the needed python libraries
* Run command `python3 -m streamlit run rag_advanced.py --server.fileWatcherType poll` to start the Streamlit server. Do not use the links generated by the command as they won't work in studio.
* To enter the Streamlit app, open and run the cell in the **StreamlitLink.ipynb** notebook. This will generate the appropiate link to enter your Streamlit app from SageMaker studio. Click on the link to enter your Streamlit app.
* **âš  Note:**  If you rerun the Streamlit server it may use a different port. Take not of the port used (port number is the last 4 digit number after the last : (colon)) and modify the `port` variable in the `StreamlitLink.ipynb` notebook to get the correct link.

To run this Streamlit App on AWS EC2 (I tested this on the Ubuntu Image)
* [Create a new ec2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
* Expose TCP port range 8500-8510 on Inbound connections of the attached Security group to the ec2 instance. TCP port 8501 is needed for Streamlit to work. See image below
* <img src="images/sg-rules.PNG" width="600"/>
* [Connect to your ec2 instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html)
* Run the appropiate commands to update the ec2 instance (`sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade` -for Ubuntu)
* Clone this git repo `git clone [github_link]`
* Install python3 and pip if not already installed
* Install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file by running the command `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run command `python3 -m streamlit run rag_advanced.py` 
* Copy the external link and paste in a new browser tab

## UI Look
The UI has Three Activities:
1. **DocumentQuery**: This uses the RAG apparoach with different retrievers (OpenSearch and Kendra) and lets you select different configurations. The user can upload a pdf and get it indexed in either OpenSearch or Kendra.

2. **Document Insights**: This is a more interactive appraoch where the user uploads a document and can interact with each page of that documnet in real time. Things like QnA, Summarization etc.

3. **Batch Document Summary**: This is an activity for Batch document summarization. The user uploads a pdf document and is able to generate a wholesome summary of the entire document.

## Note
Only Pdf documents are supported for upload at this time using this app.
